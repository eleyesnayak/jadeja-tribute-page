        Ravindrasinh Anirudhsinh Jadeja (born 6 December 1988), commonly known as Ravindra Jadeja, is an Indian
        international
        cricketer. He is an all-rounder, who bats left-handed in the middle-order and bowls left-arm orthodox spin. He
        has
        consistently been considered one of the best fielders in world cricket. He represents Saurashtra in
        first-class
        cricket and the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.

        Jadeja was part of the Indian U-19 cricket team that won the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008 under the captaincy
        of the
        current Indian captain Virat Kohli. He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka on 8 February 2009 and scored an
        unbeaten 60
        off 77 balls in that match. However, his Test debut came almost four years later, on 13 December 2012, against
        England
        at Nagpur.

        Jadeja was bought for $2 million by the Chennai Super Kings at the 2012 IPL Players Auction. He was bought by
        the
        Gujarat Lions in the 2016 IPL Players Auction for â‚¹9.5 crores after the Chennai Super Kings were banned from the
        IPL for
        two seasons. On 22 January 2017, Jadeja became the first Indian left-arm spinner to take 150 One Day
        International
        wickets, when he dismissed Sam Billings at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. In March 2017, he became the top ranked
        bowler in
        the world leaving behind Ravichandran Ashwin who held that position for a long time.
